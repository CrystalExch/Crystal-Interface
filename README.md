# Crystal

Crystal is a fully on-chain central limit order book exchange, created to bridge the gap between the transparency, security, and permissionless nature of decentralized exchanges and the speed, capital efficiency, and lower fees of traditional centralized exchanges. Built as an immutable protocol on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Crystal allows for a seamless trading experience while remaining fully self-custodial, permissionless, and decentralized. Crystal is also fully composable and can serve as spot liquidity for any DeFi app as a substitute or addition to automatic market maker exchange liquidity.
